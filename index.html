            <section id="intro"><h3>🐣 Section 1: Introduction</h3>
                <p>Becoming a superhero is no mere flap of the wings. It is an honour, a duty, and—most importantly—a transformation. The Superhero Ascension Protocol is designed to identify, prepare, and empower extraordinary individuals (avian or otherwise) for lives of justice, courage, and dramatic rooftop posing.</p>
                <p>Modelled on the meteoric rise of Captain Cluck—from humble coop to skyborne legend—this field guide lays out the crucial stages of heroic evolution, from hatching to heroism. Whether you're a feathered fledgling or a bipedal being with aspirations of greatness, your journey begins here.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="eligibility"><h3>🧬 Section 2: Eligibility Requirements</h3>
                <p>To qualify for the Superhero Ascension Protocol, you must meet the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🌀 Born during a weather anomaly, such as a thunderstorm, double rainbow, solar eclipse, or aggressive fog.</li>
                    <li>🧭 Possess moral cluckpulsion—a deep inner urge to protect others, regardless of flock or species.</li>
                    <li>💥 Survived a near-egg-sperience, such as a brush with mortality, existential poultry panic, or predator ambush.</li>
                    <li>🦊 Show resistance to foxes, propaganda, or bureaucratic nonsense.</li>
                    <li>💡 Exhibit spontaneous bursts of insight during molting seasons.</li>
                    <li>🎶 Unusual talent, such as rhythmic clucking, skywriting, or telepathic communication with barn cats</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: Traits such as excessive pride, greed for mealworms, or chronic coop gossip disqualify a candidate immediately.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="peckoning"><h3>⚡ Section 3: The Empowerment Event (a.k.a. “The Peckoning”)</h3>
                <p>Empowerment is unpredictable, cosmic, and often unrepeatable. It marks the moment the candidate’s heroic potential is fully activated, usually via exposure to a rare anomaly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🍿 Gamma-irradiated corn kernel ingestion (may cause glowing talons).</li>
                    <li>⛈️ Freak storm interaction with coop wiring or enchanted roosts.</li>
                    <li>💊 Ingestion of prototype yolk-based isotopes from rogue government programs.</li>
                    <li>📦 Accidental contact with ancient relics, such as the Golden Egg of Yolk’dmir or the Cluckatrix Crown.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Captain Cluck’s Peckoning occurred when she shielded hatchlings during a coop-collapse storm, and was struck by an arc of unknown origin—believed to be part solar flare, part maternal instinct.</p>

            <section id="powers"><h3>🧪 Section 4: Powers Manifestation Checklist</h3>
                <p>Upon transformation, candidates may exhibit one or more powers. These should be documented and tested in a controlled free-range environment under the supervision of a licensed Coopvisor.</p>

            <section id="costume"><h3>🧵 Section 5: Costume & Branding</h3>
                <p>Hero identity is nothing without style. A carefully designed costume inspires allies, unnerves villains, and looks phenomenal on trading cards.</p>
                <P>Required Elements:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emblem: Personalised crest or initials (e.g., “CC”). Should appear on chest, shoulder, or eggshell.</li>
                    <li>Cape: Optional, but highly encouraged. Aids in gliding, intimidation, and photo ops. Flame- and peck-resistant.</li>
                    <li>Utility Belt: Must include: mini cluck-kit, commemorative medallion, feed pellets, smoke bombs (chaff-style), and a backup communicator.</li>
                    <li>Boots/Claw Wraps: For grip, shock absorption, and dramatic stances.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recommended Colours:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🔴 Crimson (for courage)</li>
                    <li>💛 Yellow (for hope)</li>
                    <li>⚫ Black (for stealth missions and formality)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Avoid beige, olive, or coop-camo unless you're undercover.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="coopmandments"><h3>📜 Section 6: The Hero’s Coopmandments</h3>

                </ol>
                <p>Infractions may result in temporary de-caping or mandatory public nest-cleaning service.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="retirement"><h3>🧓 Section 7: Retirement & Legacy Planning</h3>
                <p>No hero flaps forever. When the time comes to step aside, proper legacy planning ensures the flame is passed, not extinguished.</p>
                <p>Retirement Conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Defeating an arch-nemesis or saving a full flock.</li>
                    <li>📖 Completing at least three major heroic arcs.</li>
                    <li>🎓 Successfully training a certified Sidekick (see Hatchery Program Doc 14-EGG).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ceremony: A golden yolk-dipping of the feathers, 21-cluck salute, and an honorary egg-shaped plaque in the Hall of Wings.</p>
                <p>Captain Cluck’s mysterious disappearance over the Winds of Destiny has yet to be resolved. Her signal beacon still glows—faintly—in the upper skies.</p>
